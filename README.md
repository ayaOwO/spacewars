# spacewars

##### This game is going to be constructed in the following manner:
##### We are going to have 22 planets of which 1 is going to belong to each of the players in the beggining.
##### The planets are going to be given random basic unit garrison values.
##### Every 1 tick (24 ticks in every second) a unit is going to be added to each of the player's planets.
##### Players can command units to attack planets and capture them if they go down to 0 garrison and are then infiltrated by an enemy unit.
##### Good luck!

Implementation will be via an array of planets, queue of commands per tick, queue of gui objects.
